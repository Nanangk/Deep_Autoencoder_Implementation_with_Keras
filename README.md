# Deep_Autoencoder_Implementation_with_Keras
This project aim to implementation of Deep Autoencoder with Keras, this project use fashion mnist dataset from keras  Fashion mnist is is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.
